            PHRC Life Space Organization was founded in 2014 under the visionary
            leadership of the Rajasthani & Gujarati Charitable Foundation - a
            philanthropic body formed by communities deeply rooted in Pune for
            decades. Their values of service and giving back laid the foundation
            for some of the city&apos;s most respected institutions.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.description}>
            One of their landmark initiatives was the establishment of the Poona
            Hospital & Research Centre, a 300-bed, NABH-accredited tertiary care
            hospital known for quality care, modern facilities, and
            affordability. For over 40 years, it has served as a beacon of trust
            for patients in Pune and beyond.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.description}>
            Building on this legacy, PHRC Life Space Organization was created to
            scale these values into the futureâ€”with{" "}
            <span className={styles.bold}>PHRC Health City</span>, a
            next-generation campus combining healthcare, education, and research
            on a 14-acre landscape in Undri, Pune.
