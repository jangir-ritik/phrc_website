            PHRC Life Space Organization was founded in 2014 under the
            mentorship of Rajasthani & Gujarati Charitable Foundation - a
            platform that has been serving healthcare needs for over 40 years.
            They serve as a beacon of hope and trust that laid the foundation
            for charitable healthcare services.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.description}>
            One of their landmark initiatives was the establishment of the Poona
            Hospital & Research Centre, a 300-bed NABH accredited tertiary care
            hospital known for quality care, modern facilities, and
            affordability. For over 40 years, it has served as a beacon of trust
            by patients in Pune and beyond.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.description}>
            Building on this legacy, PHRC Life Space Organization was created to
            build more secure and fair life spacesâ€”PHRC Health City. A next
            generation campus combining healthcare, education, and research in a
            14-acre landscape - PHRC Life.
